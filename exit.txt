Hello! thank you for adding me to your server. 
I come with several tools to assist in moderating your server. 
To setup these tools, type !setup adminTools, and I will make a DM session with you. 
(You must be the owner or have a role with the administrator permission)

1/6) Spam:
	Enable spam control? `yes` | `no`
	// Enable automatic spam detection and handling
	
	Trigger (choose one or more): `similarity` | `frequency`
	// What will trigger the spam detection.
	// similarity: based upon relative similarity between consecutive messages
	// frequency: based upon message frequency i.e. rapidly posting
	
		Frequency (per minute): `<integer>`
		// Triggers when the frequency of messages exceeds
	
		Consecutive similar messages (up to 30): `<integer>`
		// Triggers when the specified number of messages are all similar
	
			Similarity sensitivity: `low` | `medium` | `high`
			// Low: Only identical messages
			// Medium: One or two letters different
			// High: One or two words different
	
	Action (choose one): `warn` | `mute <integer>` | `kick` | 'ban <integer>'
	// <integer> represents minutes
	// Action to take when spam is detected

		Repeat offense: `none` | `warn` | `mute <integer>` | `kick` | `ban <integer>`
		// <integer> represents minutes
		// Action to take for repeated spam offenses
